# Test-Task-QA-SF
A sample of a RESTful api and a testsuite testing it

## Task
The task was for me to build a an automated test suite for a RESTful API that simulates a trading platform with WebSocket support. Also I was required to dockerize both the test-Suite and the server.

### Basic description

The project consists of 2 python scripts, 2 .bat files, 1 dummy database file with a json format and 1 Dockerfile with the necessary commands for containerizing the result.

The python script with the name "api_server.py" creates the RESTful API server, and covers the basic requirements 1-5 + the 1st advanced requirement mentioned in the pdf file with the instructions.
